God Is Dead?,Black Sabbath,13,1/1/2013,FALSE,"Lost in the darkness
I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscious
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine
You keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?
Rivers of evil
Run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow, there is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust,
Leaves you empty and unwhole?
When will this nightmare be over? Tell me!
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a mental death
I empathize with enemes
Until the timing's right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light
I watch the rain
As it turns red
Give me more wine
I don't need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again
On the other side
Do you believe a word
What the good book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale
And God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
Right!
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down
The rain turns red
I don't believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead"
The Enemy Inside,Dream Theater,Dream Theater,9/16/2013,FALSE,"Over and over again
I relive the moment
I'm bearing the burden within
Open wounds hidden under my skin

Pain as real as a cut that bleeds
The face I see every time I try to sleep
Is staring at me crying

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I sever myself from the world
And shut down completely
All alone in my own living hell
Overcome with irrational fear

Under the weight of the world on my chest
I buckle and break as I try to catch my breath
Tell me I'm not dying!

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside

I'm a burden, I'm a travesty
I'm a prisoner of regret
Between the flashbacks and the violent dreams
I am hanging on the edge

Disaster lurks around the bend
Paradise came to an end
And no magic pill
Can bring it back again

I'm running from the enemy inside
Looking for the life I left behind
These suffocating memories
Are etched upon my mind
And I can't escape from the enemy inside "
Temper Temper,Bullet For My Valentine,Temper Temper (Deluxe Version),2/8/2013,FALSE,"This time you'd better bite your tongue
Think twice before you open that mouth

Being from rage, will it overcome?
I feel the tension rising high
I feel a hump down in my chest

Can't hold it back
Here comes my
Temper temper, time to explode
Feels good when I lose control
Temper temper, time to explode
Chamber's empty, time to reload
Too late 'cause now you can't disarm
Too slow, you know you should've backed down
Did you think before you crossed that line?
This intervention's gonna be divine
I feel the time is crawling near
I feel the sweat dripping down my face

Can't hold it back

Heartbreaker,Motorhead,Aftershock,10/18/2013,FALSE,"Careful where you stand now boy
Everything has changed
Got to search and destroy
Everything has changed
Got to move stop the dreams
All protection gone
Listen how the people scream
On and on and on
Time to get away from here
You won't see me shed a tear
No time to say goodbye
Danger in the dead of night
Takes away the strength to fight
All we know is black despair
Heartbreaker
You remember what you said
In the first attack
Stand your ground fight your best
Drop 'em in their tracks
Now the story changed again
Sing a different song
Listen how the shots ring out
On and on and on
Time to get away my dear
There's no future for us here
Say a prayer and fly
Horror from the break of day
Make a strong man turn away
All we know is black despair
Heartbreaker
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
All the lights are dying now
See the shadows fall
Nearly all the people gone
Soon their rights 'n' all
Running through the ruins
All directions wrong
Listen to the world scream out
On and on and on
Time to get us outta here
No emotion only fear
Say a last goodbye
Monsters at the edge of time
Waiting 'til we cross the line
All we find is black despair
Heartbreaker
Foul things reach out for blood
Never does a bit of good
All we find is black despair
Heartbreaker

Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires
I am he, the born-less one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare, to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devils own, Lucifer's my name
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream, ow
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide, you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone your soul will bleed to death
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight
The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons, battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die, oh, oh
One more dies and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you young man
But I'll see you damned in endless night
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight"
End Of The Beginning,Black Sabbath,13,1/1/2013,FALSE,"Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?
Reanimation of the sequence
Rewind the future to the past
To find the source of the solution

Fast forward to the secrets of your code
Your life's on overload
Delete or save
The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know
Which way to go
You may be lost and confused
A second chance your turn to lose
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up resist and be the master of your fate
Don't look back live for today - tomorrow is too late

Occupied inside a human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free

The Looking Glass,Dream Theater,Dream Theater,9/16/2013,FALSE,"I would not expect you felt unnoticed and ignored
Better to rise above the clouds Then be a stranger in the crowd
All that you protected doesn't matter anymore
Rather be stripped of all your pride
Than watch your dreams be cast aside
You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying stardom
Singing your own praise
You live without shame
You're digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass
You are not content with being nameless and unknown
Trying to rise above the fray
Eager to give it all away
Some will not admit that 15 minutes have expired
Too much attention much too soon
Don't see you walking on the moon
You are caught up in your gravity
Bathing in the spotlight
Imitating fame
You live without shame
You're digging up a gold mine
Standing on the sidelines
Watching through the looking glass
You are caught up in your gravity
Glorifying madness
Singing your own praise
You live without shame

Ride the Lightning (Live),Metallica,Metallica Through The Never (Music from the Motion Picture),2013,FALSE,"Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me

Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
""I'll take your life from you?""

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end

Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see

How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Freed from this frightening dream

Trying to make me well

You will be cast out

Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their ""god"" of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from Chaos roused for war?

Burn the shrines of fettered sheep

Once its spell ran headlong through my veins

The paradigm of bliss
Hot whispers on the wind
In swanlike curves I graced salvation

Amidst both world I promised her
Eternity would be beautiful

Yet on the cusp
I still not truly dared

Her eyes plied hard a burning will
Beseeching on her knees
Like Salome unfulfilled

I hung between two thieves
Guilt and spilt desire
Until that flame became a fire
All consuming

With strength renewed
I turned again
Death all lit up by my perfect victim

And she grew
The scourge of men
They hissed her name in perverted dictum
